Cippus is a digital platform that maps Portugal's historical heritage, transforming every museum, ruin, or statue into an interactive landmark.

## Overview

The platform connects visitors to artifacts through a system of detailed tabs and QR code gamification. Cippus allows users to collect digital visit stamps and unlock stories hidden in time, making the exploration of Portuguese history an engaging and collection-based experience.
